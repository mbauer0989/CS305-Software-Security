# CS305-Software-Security

#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company, they develop financial plans. This company wanted to implement the most current and effective software security. They wanted their client's data and financial information to be protected. They wanted a file verification step to their web application using a checksum. 

#What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I was able to figure out what best encryption algorithm would best meet their needs. It is important to code securely because you can introduce vulnerabilities if you do not. You can allow access to certain parts and make it easy for someone trying to be malicious. Software security adds protection from outside nefarious actors, this allows the company to operate without any issues or being compromised. Software security adds to the reputation of a company that clients can trust their information is secure. 

#What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I think the most challenging was figuring out what a false positive was. Working through the process allowed me to see how everything works and gave a better understanding since I am a more hands on learner.

#How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I looked at what was needed and what would work best for those areas. I would, if possible, have another person look over and compare notes. I would also use different tools to assess and not rely on only one.

#How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ran the code to make sure there were no errors that would stop it from compiling. I then checked the code for any possible vulnerabilities. I rechecked and ran the same tests on everything after to make sure there were no vulnerabilities introduced. 

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used the OWASP dependency check tool and this will be helpful to find vulnerabilities in future assignments. 

#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would want to showcase how I can find vulnerabilities and find how to fix these issues. I would want to showcase the fact that I will do research and find how to fix or what to add to secure an area.
